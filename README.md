## Flow Client - Custom Frontend Client for Node-RED

This documentation serves as a record of the existing functionality of our app that has already been implemented, along with technical implementation details that future developers and newcomers can refer to.

### Feature Overview

-   **Flow Canvas**: Users can add, arrange, and connect nodes on a scalable and navigable canvas that supports zooming and panning.
-   **Node Palette**: A sidebar displays nodes categorized by type or functionality, with search and filter capabilities to streamline finding and selecting nodes.
-   **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Enables users to drag nodes from the node palette onto the canvas, facilitating intuitive flow construction.
-   **Node Connection Functionality**: Supports drawing connections between nodes with enhanced visual feedback and auto-attachment features for ease of use.
-   **Node Editor UI**: Provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and editing node properties, allowing detailed customization of node attributes.

### Technical Implementation

-   **Flow Canvas**:

    -   Implemented using `@projectstorm/react-diagrams` to provide a scalable and interactive diagramming interface.
    -   Supports high-performance rendering even with a large number of nodes and connections.

-   **Node Palette**:

    -   Developed with React components, allowing dynamic searching and filtering of nodes.
    -   Utilizes `react-dnd` for drag-and-drop capabilities from the palette to the canvas.

-   **Drag-and-Drop Interface**:

    -   Integrates `react-dnd` to handle complex drag-and-drop scenarios, enhancing the user experience by allowing nodes to be visually dragged across the interface.

-   **Node Connection Functionality**:

    -   Utilizes `@projectstorm/react-diagrams` for creating and managing connections with visual feedback and auto-attachment logic to simplify the connection process.

-   **Node Editor UI**:
    -   Implements UI components for editing node properties, including individual node attributes and dialog boxes for configuration.
    -   Re-implements a significant portion of Node-RED's editor logic within our flow-client to ensure accurate rendering and functionality of Node-RED nodes.

### Libraries and Frameworks

-   **@projectstorm/react-diagrams**: Used for creating and managing the diagram canvas, custom nodes, ports, and links.
-   **react-dnd**: Utilized for adding drag-and-drop functionality to the node palette and canvas, enhancing the interactive experience.
-   **react-hook-form**: Considered for future enhancements to handle form state and validation within the application.

## Planning Session - Flow Builder

### Project Scope

The custom frontend client for Node-RED will focus on providing an intuitive and efficient user experience for building and managing flows. The core functionalities will include:

-   **Flow Builder**: This is the most critical part of the application. It will allow users to add nodes to a canvas through drag and drop, finish connections between nodes, and access node options via a context menu. The flow builder will enable users to visually create and edit flows, making the process as intuitive as possible.

-   **Display of Available Nodes**: A sidebar on the left-hand side of the interface will display the available nodes. This sidebar will categorize nodes by their types or functionalities, allowing users to easily find and select the nodes they need for their flows.

-   **Creation of New Flows and Subflows**: Users will be able to create new flows and subflows within the application. This functionality will support organizing complex projects by allowing users to segment their work into manageable, modular flows and subflows.

-   **Saving Flows**: The client will integrate with the Node-RED API to save the current state of flows to a `flows.json` file, mirroring the functionality of the existing Node-RED frontend. This feature ensures that users can persist their work and retrieve it later, maintaining continuity in their project development.

### Additional MVP Considerations

-   **Node Configuration and Editing**: Provide a user-friendly interface for configuring and editing node properties to tailor the behavior of each node within the flows.

-   **Flow Debugging and Testing Tools**: Incorporate basic debugging tools to assist users in testing and troubleshooting their flows, enhancing the development experience.

-   **Import/Export Flows**: Enable users to import and export their flows in JSON format, facilitating easy sharing, backup, and migration of work.

-   **Responsive Design**: Ensure the frontend client is accessible and usable across various devices by adopting a responsive design approach.

### Development Environment Setup
