## Custom Frontend Client for Node-RED - Planning Session

### Project Scope

The custom frontend client for Node-RED will focus on providing an intuitive and efficient user experience for building and managing flows. The core functionalities will include:

-   **Flow Builder**: This is the most critical part of the application. It will allow users to add nodes to a canvas through drag and drop, finish connections between nodes, and access node options via a context menu. The flow builder will enable users to visually create and edit flows, making the process as intuitive as possible.

-   **Display of Available Nodes**: A sidebar on the left-hand side of the interface will display the available nodes. This sidebar will categorize nodes by their types or functionalities, allowing users to easily find and select the nodes they need for their flows.

-   **Creation of New Flows and Subflows**: Users will be able to create new flows and subflows within the application. This functionality will support organizing complex projects by allowing users to segment their work into manageable, modular flows and subflows.

-   **Saving Flows**: The client will integrate with the Node-RED API to save the current state of flows to a `flows.json` file, mirroring the functionality of the existing Node-RED frontend. This feature ensures that users can persist their work and retrieve it later, maintaining continuity in their project development.

### Additional MVP Considerations

-   **Node Configuration and Editing**: Provide a user-friendly interface for configuring and editing node properties to tailor the behavior of each node within the flows.

-   **Flow Debugging and Testing Tools**: Incorporate basic debugging tools to assist users in testing and troubleshooting their flows, enhancing the development experience.

-   **Import/Export Flows**: Enable users to import and export their flows in JSON format, facilitating easy sharing, backup, and migration of work.

-   **Responsive Design**: Ensure the frontend client is accessible and usable across various devices by adopting a responsive design approach.

    -   **Technical Requirements**:
        -   Implement a scalable and navigable canvas that supports zooming and panning.
        -   Design considerations must include how nodes will be displayed, selected, and how connections between nodes will be visualized.
        -   The canvas should support high performance, even with a large number of nodes and connections.
        -   Integration points with `@projectstorm/react-diagrams` need to be identified and utilized for rendering the canvas and its elements.
        -   To accomplish this task, the following components from `@projectstorm/react-diagrams` and React will be utilized:
            1. **DiagramEngine**: Manages the rendering and operation of the diagram, handling the setup and rendering of the canvas, nodes, and links.
            2. **DiagramModel**: Represents the model of the diagram, including nodes, links, and their connections. This is used by the `DiagramEngine` to render the diagram.
            3. **CanvasWidget**: Renders the flow canvas, taking a `DiagramEngine` as a prop and displaying the diagram based on the current model.
            4. **DefaultNodeModel** and **DefaultPortModel**: Used for creating nodes with ports that can be connected with links. These models support the basic functionality needed for the initial task.
            5. **DefaultLinkModel**: Represents the connections between ports on different nodes, supporting straight and curved links that can be styled.
-   **FB-02** (Priority: 2): Implement the node palette with search and filter capabilities.
    -   **Objective**: Develop a sidebar or palette that displays available nodes, allowing users to search and filter nodes to find what they need quickly.

        -   Utilize `@projectstorm/react-diagrams` for managing the rendering and logic of connections, ensuring compatibility with the library's way of handling links.
        -   Connections should be visually distinct and should support different styles (straight lines, curves) to enhance readability.
        -   Include validation to ensure that connections between incompatible node types or ports are not allowed.
        -   Provide visual feedback during the connection process, such as highlighting compatible ports when drawing a connection.

## Flow Builder Development - Technical Details

The Flow Builder is the cornerstone of our custom frontend client for Node-RED, enabling users to visually create and edit flows with ease. To achieve a robust, intuitive, and efficient development of this epic, we have selected the following key libraries:

### @projectstorm/react-diagrams

-   **Purpose**: Serves as the core library for rendering the flow diagrams. It provides the functionality to create custom nodes, ports, and links, making it ideal for building complex, interactive diagrams with drag-and-drop capabilities.
-   **Documentation**: [https://projectstorm.gitbook.io/react-diagrams/](https://projectstorm.gitbook.io/react-diagrams/)

### react-dnd

-   **Purpose**: Facilitates the drag-and-drop functionality within the flow builder, allowing users to drag nodes from the sidebar into the canvas and arrange them to form flows. Its flexible API supports complex drag-and-drop scenarios, which are essential for a seamless user experience in flow construction.
-   **Documentation**: [https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about)

### react-hook-form

-   **Purpose**: Used for managing forms within the application, particularly for node configuration dialogs. React Hook Form provides an efficient, flexible, and extensible way to handle form state and validation, improving the performance and user experience of form interactions.
-   **Documentation**: [https://react-hook-form.com/](https://react-hook-form.com/)

### Integration Strategy

-   **@projectstorm/react-diagrams** will be utilized to construct the visual flow editor interface, enabling the creation, connection, and configuration of nodes within a flow.
-   **react-dnd** will be integrated with @projectstorm/react-diagrams to enhance the user interface with drag-and-drop capabilities, allowing for an intuitive method of adding and organizing nodes within the flow canvas.
-   **react-hook-form** will be employed in modal dialogs for node configuration, ensuring that form data is efficiently managed and validated, providing a user-friendly configuration experience.

By leveraging these libraries, we aim to build a Flow Builder that is not only powerful and flexible but also intuitive and user-friendly. This will enable users to efficiently create and manage their Node-RED flows directly within our custom frontend client.
