## Flow Client - Custom Frontend Client for Node-RED

This documentation serves as a record of the existing functionality of our app that has already been implemented, along with technical implementation details that future developers and newcomers can refer to.

### Feature Overview

-   **Flow Canvas**: Users can add, arrange, and connect nodes on a scalable and navigable canvas that supports zooming and panning.
-   **Node Palette**: A sidebar displays nodes categorized by type or functionality, with search and filter capabilities to streamline finding and selecting nodes.
-   **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Enables users to drag nodes from the node palette onto the canvas, facilitating intuitive flow construction.
-   **Node Connection Functionality**: Supports drawing connections between nodes with enhanced visual feedback and auto-attachment features for ease of use.
-   **Node Editor UI**: Provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and editing node properties, allowing detailed customization of node attributes.
-   **Builder Layout**: Features a primary sidebar with sections for file tree, config nodes, context data, and general information, enhancing navigation and accessibility. A secondary sidebar includes the node palette and a new help browser section. Tabs at the top of the interface allow users to manage multiple flows or views simultaneously. A console at the bottom displays debug outputs and system messages, aiding in troubleshooting and development. A theme switcher in the header allows users to toggle between light and dark modes.
-   **Tabbed Layout for Multiple Flows**: A dynamic tab system at the top of the interface where each tab represents an open flow. Each tab can host an instance of the flow-canvas component, maintaining the state of each flow independently. Functionality to add, close, and switch tabs without losing work, with prompt saving or caching options.
-   **File Tree in Primary Sidebar**: A collapsible file tree that displays all available flows and subflows categorized by projects or folders. Users can interact with the file tree to open a flow in a new tab, delete a flow, or create a new flow.

### Technical Implementation

-   **Flow Canvas**:

    -   Implemented using `@projectstorm/react-diagrams` to provide a scalable and interactive diagramming interface.
    -   Supports high-performance rendering even with a large number of nodes and connections.

-   **Node Palette**:

    -   Developed with React components, allowing dynamic searching and filtering of nodes.
    -   Utilizes `react-dnd` for drag-and-drop capabilities from the palette to the canvas.

-   **Drag-and-Drop Interface**:

    -   Integrates `react-dnd` to handle complex drag-and-drop scenarios, enhancing the user experience by allowing nodes to be visually dragged across the interface.

-   **Node Connection Functionality**:

    -   Utilizes `@projectstorm/react-diagrams` for creating and managing connections with visual feedback and auto-attachment logic to simplify the connection process.

-   **Node Editor UI**:

    -   Implements UI components for editing node properties, including individual node attributes and dialog boxes for configuration.
    -   Re-implements a significant portion of Node-RED's editor logic within our flow-client to ensure accurate rendering and functionality of Node-RED nodes.

-   **File tree**:
    -   A few different React libraries were evaluated, but it was decided to go with a custom solution to display the file tree.

### Libraries and Frameworks

-   **@projectstorm/react-diagrams**: Used for creating and managing the diagram canvas, custom nodes, ports, and links.
-   **react-dnd**: Utilized for adding drag-and-drop functionality to the node palette and canvas, enhancing the interactive experience.
-   **react-hook-form**: Considered for future enhancements to handle form state and validation within the application.
-   **react-tooltip**: Used for tooltips in the flow builder.
