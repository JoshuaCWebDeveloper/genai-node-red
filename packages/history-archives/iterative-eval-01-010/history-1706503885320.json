Based on your risk tolerance and financial goals, I'm going to recommend the following plan:\n\n1. Invest 80% ($8,000) of your savings into a high-yield savings account at an online bank or credit union. Look for institutions that offer competitive interest rates and have excellent customer service.\n2. Use the remaining $2,000 to purchase a low-risk index fund or ETF. Select a broad market index such as the S&P 500, which tracks the performance of the largest companies in the United States.\n3. Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.\n4. Consider reinvesting any dividends or capital gains back into your investments to compound your returns over time.\n5. Keep track of market conditions and be prepared to adjust your strategy if the risk/reward ratio shifts significantly in favor of higher-risk investments.\n\nBy following this plan, you can potentially earn passive income while maintaining a low-risk portfolio. Remember that investing always carries some level of risk, so be prepared for fluctuations in the value of your investments."}],"streaming":null}
