Dividend stocks\n2. REITs\n3. Bonds\n4. Index funds or ETFs\n\nHere is a brief investment plan that will meet your goal using these options:\n\n1. Allocate 50% of your savings to dividend stocks. Look for companies with a strong track record of paying out dividends and a history of increasing those dividends over time. You can choose individual stocks or invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund.\n2. Allocate 30% of your savings to REITs. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) allow you to invest in real estate without owning physical properties. They generate passive income through rental income and can offer a high dividend yield.\n3. Allocate 15% of your savings to bonds. Bonds are a low-risk investment that provides a steady stream of income. Choose bonds with a high credit rating and a maturity date that aligns with your investment time horizon.\n4. Allocate 5% of your savings to index funds or ETFs. These funds track the performance of a particular stock market index, such as the S&P 500. They offer broad diversification and can provide a steady stream of income through dividends.\n\nTo implement this investment strategy:\n\n1. Open an account with a brokerage firm that offers access to the types of investments you plan to make.\n2. Research and select individual dividend stocks, REITs, bonds, index funds, or ETFs that align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.\n3. Diversify your portfolio by investing in a mix of these asset classes to minimize risk and maximize returns.\n4. Set up automatic dividend reinvestment for your dividend stocks and REITs to compound your earnings over time.\n5. Monitor your portfolio regularly to ensure that it remains aligned with your investment objectives and make adjustments as needed."}],"streaming":null}
