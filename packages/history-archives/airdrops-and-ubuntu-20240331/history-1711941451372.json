Enter your email address (or phone number) and choose a password for your new account. Make sure to choose something that is difficult to guess but easy for you to remember.\n3. Agree to the Twitter terms of service and privacy policy by checking the appropriate boxes.\n4. Choose a username and profile picture that represent you or your brand.
