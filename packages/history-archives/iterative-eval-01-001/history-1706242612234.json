Here's a comprehensive step-by-step plan to help you reach your target:\n\n1. Assess risk tolerance and investment timeline\nBefore investing, it's essential to understand your risk tolerance and the desired investment timeline. This information will help you choose appropriate investment options that align with your goals.\n2. Open a high-yield savings account\nA high-yield savings account can be an excellent place to park your $10,000 initially. These accounts typically offer interest rates higher than traditional savings accounts, allowing you to earn some passive income while keeping your funds easily accessible. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the annual percentage yield (APY) on high-yield savings accounts ranged from 0.5% to 0.7%. However, please note that interest rates may have changed since then. Some popular options include:\n* Capital One 360 (1.00% APY)\n* Ally Bank (0.50% APY)\n* CIT Bank (0.40% APY)\n\nMinimum balance requirements for these accounts are generally low, usually around $0 or $100. Make sure to compare the current rates and requirements before choosing an account.\n3. Invest in certificates of deposit (CDs)\nCDs can be an excellent option if you're comfortable locking your funds away for a specific period. Look for CDs with high interest rates and terms that align with your investment goals. As of my knowledge cutoff, 5-year CDs offered interest rates between 0.75% and 1.0%. Again, please note that interest rates may have changed since then. Some examples of institutions offering competitive CD rates include:\n* Synchrony Bank\n* Marcus by Goldman Sachs\n* Barclays\n4. Invest in dividend stocks\nDividend stocks can provide a steady stream of passive income. However, it's essential to choose stocks with a history of consistent payouts and growth potential. Some examples of successful dividend stocks include:\n* Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ)\n* Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG)\n* Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO)\n5. Invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs)\nREITs allow you to earn passive income from real estate investments without directly owning or managing properties. REITs specialize in different property types, such as residential, commercial, and industrial properties. Some examples of successful REITs include:\n* Simon Property Group (NYSE: SPG)\n* Crown Castle International (NYSE: CCI)\n* Healthcare Trust of America (NYSE: HTA)\n6. Invest in peer-to-peer lending platforms\nPeer-to-peer lending platforms connect borrowers with investors, allowing you to earn passive income through interest on loans. Some popular P2P lending platforms with low default rates include:\n* LendingClub (NYSE: LC)\n* Prosper\n* Upstart\n7. Diversify investments and manage risks\nTo minimize risk, it's important to diversify your invest"}],"streaming":null}
